This project is a single page application using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Sass, Javascript, and jQuery. It also uses AJAX and to interact with an API.

I created a [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/pTzOi2m0/tic-tac-toe-client) to plan and track my progress, and included a list to hold my user stories.

I finished my user stories before beginning to code, and Iâ€™m proud of what I came up with. I feel good about how well I translated the project requirements into good user stories and about the UI ideas I added to them. My UI stories were basically: two players playing on the same machine, with the machine owner being the host, and the guest taking the first and subsequent odd turns.

I had a sense of the of the magnitude of the project from my previous studies in CSS and JavaScript, and the level of understanding I'm at with both. I needed to try to get as many requirements met as possible in less than a week. I experimented with abandoning my usual methodical approach to doing everything well, and focused instead on trying to work quickly... which led me to create an [overly simplistic wireframe](https://github.com/RiverMagnetic/tic-tac-toe-client/blob/master/wireframes/first-tic-tac-toe-wireframe.jpg).

However, I did well at recognizing early on that my [wireframes needed to be fully sketched](https://github.com/RiverMagnetic/tic-tac-toe-client/blob/master/wireframes/detailed-tic-tac-toe-wireframe.jpg).

Because I put in the time to do so at that point, the mistake of not doing it earlier didn't end up impacting my code.
I had to [refactor part of my wireframes](https://github.com/RiverMagnetic/tic-tac-toe-client/blob/master/wireframes/turn-logic-refactor-tic-tac-toe-wireframe.jpg) a little later in conjunction with refactoring my user stories... but from my experience such things are par for the course.

Each day I made a sprint schedule that I knew was highly improbable to meet. The purpose of this was to:
* give myself a motivational challenge,
* try to get a broad view of how all the requirements would work together by touching on them all briefly at least once (this seemed important since I was new to working with API's), and
* to try to avoid going down too many rabbit holes (since the next thing on the schedule was always minutes away).

I think it was a worthy experiment. I believe that the first project we are given to do in General Assembly is not only about the project content. It's also about trying and learning what project management approaches serve us or don't in this environment, and refactoring our approaches accordingly for next time. I like how I've approached the project so far and will refactor according to what I learn as I continue to improve it.

I used source control to keep track of changes in my project. Although I haven't experienced any actual setbacks in terms of lost work, committing as frequently as I think I should is a work in progress. My habits with this aren't as good as I'd like them to be so far, but I'm continually taking notice, thinking about how to do better, and experimenting with approaches... I'm definitely improving!

I solved problems that came up along the way by using console logs, checking the console for error messages, doing research on the internet, looking over what we covered in class, asking questions of instructors, and using the issue queue. I got in the habit of checking how my app was rendering on my local browser every time I added something, so that if anything went wrong I wouldn't wonder how far back I made a mistake.
