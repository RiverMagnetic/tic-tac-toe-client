HTML:
Has 9 empty divs.
Each div has an ID.

JS:
for turns: modulus for odd/even, or array of turn number or index, or hard code numbers.
if (empty === true) {

if (turn === odd/guest ) {

on.click < Div with certain IDchange innerHTML to X >

 } else if (turn === even/host) {

on.click < Div with certain ID change innerHTML to O >
