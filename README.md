I finished my user stories before beginning to code, and Im proud of what I came up with. Until after I wrote the user stories for this project, I felt shaky about what a user story should look like and wondered if I wrote them very well. Maybe I'll be shown how to do this even better in the future, but I feel really good about how well I translated the project requirements into good user stories and the UI ideas I added to them. My UI stories were basically: two players playing on the same machine, with the machine owner being the host, and the guest taking the first and subsequent odd turns) I later changed those based on the instructors' understanding of the API requirements. Now, however, we are exploring whether user stories such as my first drafts can meet the actual requirements.


I had a sense of the of the magnitude of the project from my previous studies in CSS and JavaScript, and the level of understanding I'm at with both. Carrying this, I faced the need to try to get as many requirements met as possible in less than a week. Because of this, I felt I should abandon my usual methodical approach to doing everything *well*, and focus instead on trying to work *quickly*... which led me to create an overly simplistic wireframe. However, I did well at recognizing early on that my wireframes needed to be fully sketched. Because I put in the time to do so at that point, that mistake didn't end up impacting my code.


Each day I made a sprint schedule that I knew was highly improbable to meet. The purpose of this was to:

- Give myself a motivational challenge,
- Try to get a broad view of how all the requirements would work together by touching on them all briefly at least once (this seemed important since I was new to working with API's), and
- to try to avoid going down too many rabbit holes (since the next thing on the schedule was always minutes away).

I think it was a worthy experiment. I believe that the first project we are given to do in General Assembly is not only about the project content. It's also about trying and learning what project management approaches serve us or don't in this environment, and refactoring our approaches accordingly for next time. I like how I've approached the project so far and will refactor according to what I learn as I continue to improve it.
