HTML:
Has 9 empty divs.
Each div has an ID.

JS:

Possibility:

in a game there are two players (objects) (are created?) as follows:
player {
email:"<whatever email is signed in with first>"
role: host,
mark: X,
turn: odd,
}

player {
email:"<whatever email is signed in with second>"
role: guest,
mark: O,
turn: even,
}

the player prototype: {

methods:[
total games won: function{}
play: function{
  places this.mark value in clicked empty div
}]

for turns: modulus for odd/even, or array of turn number or index, or hard code numbers.
if (empty === true) {

if (turn === odd/guest ) {

on.click < Div with certain ID change innerHTML to X >

 } else if (turn === even/host) {

on.click < Div with certain ID change innerHTML to O >

} do I need an else statement?

} do I need an else statement?
